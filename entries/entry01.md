# Entry 1

This far I think I'm pretty set on what I want my topic to be. I want to focus on bluetooth, how it has changed and been used in
apps, and how it can be a privacy/security problem. I want to do this by looking at the history of bluetooth and how it has
advanced and etc. From that I can look at how apps want to use bluetooth for no reason sometimes or hackers use your bluetooth 
connection to leak private information.

Getting reliable information for the history of bluetooth shouldn't be too hard as there is a bluetooth website just for the history
of bluetooth and how it has changed. From here I can get a basic understanding and really see the changes over the years.

I also want to plan ahead and see what hackers use to view people's private information through bluetooth. Are there tools used to
hack bluetooth connections? Is there some type of hyjacking? Or even is it on private or public connection through the public and
etc. This is something I would have to look into in the future to further understand how complex the process of bluetooth hacking
might be. LINK: https://cyware.com/news/latest-bluetooth-hacking-techniques-expose-new-attack-vectors-for-hackers-a16cfb5e

Outside my project it really has made me more weary of time management. I thought that bluetooth wouldn't be as complicated as it is
but I need to prepare for that by setting aside time. By doing this I can function much better when it comes to research and overall
learning in general. As a side note, I also have been more cautious when it comes to cybersecurity. I usually always turn off my 
bluetooth when I'm not using it, as before I didn't think it was an issue. 

Altogether I think I have a lot of time and learning ahead of me that I could portray in a website. I think it will be very interesting
and I really want to convey my learning through blog entries as well.
